What causes a hard fork?
--* New Bitcoin software which expands block acceptance rules relative to earlier versions.
-- When a single transaction contains multiple outputs

What is generally being referred to when discussing a miner's 'memory pool'?
-- The list of that node's peer nodes

A hard fork is considered backward-compatible with older bitcoin software.
-- True
--* False


What are some arguments against raising the block size limit?
-- (a) Raising the limit will make it easier for small operators to run full nodes
--* (b) Raising the limit will make it harder for small operators to run full nodes
-- (c) Raising the limit will make it harder for large operators to run full nodes

-- a and b
-- b and c
-- a, b, and c
-- a, b, c, and d


What are some arguments in favor of raising the block size limit?

-- (c) Raising the limit will make transactions confirm faster
-- (d) Raising the limit may break SHA-256 hashing assumptions
--* a and b
-- b and c
-- a, b, and c
-- a, b, c, and d


Why were graphics cards suited to Bitcoin's mining algorithm?
-- Because they have a lot of built-in memory
-- Because they're better than most CPUs at general serial computation
--* Because they're very good at parallel computation
-- Graphics cards were not used for bitcoin mining


Which mining hardware generally uses the least energy per computed hash?
-- GPUs
-- FPGAs
--* ASICs
-- CPUs

-- Yes
--* No


The Bitcoin protocol rewards miners' work through:
-- (a) New coin issuance
-- (b) A fixed percentage of every transaction
-- (c) Voluntary transaction fees
-- (d) There is no protocol-level means to reward miners
-- a and b
--* a and c
-- b and c


The projected supply of bitcoin:
-- Is released in 25BTC batches every 10 minutes, until sometime in 2140
-- Is released in 25BTC batches with no planned end date
-- Will level off eventually at some fixed rate of low inflation
--* Asymptotically approaches a fixed maximum supply


When your transaction is included in a valid block, that event is commonly called:
-- A validation
--* A confirmation
-- A verification
-- A proof-of-work

How quickly does Bitcoin "settle"?
-- Instantly
-- Within 10 minutes
-- Within 1 hour
-- After 1 confirmation
-- After 6 confirmations
