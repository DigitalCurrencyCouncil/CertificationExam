--* True
-- False


What has Gavin Andresen proposed as an appropriate solution to the blocksize debate?
--* Raising it roughly in lockstep with expected general internet bandwidth gains
-- Eventually removing the max-blocksize cap completely
-- Doubling it at every reward halving
-- Doing a one time ten-fold raise


Which of these properties does Bitcoin have?
--* (a) Very small or no transaction costs
-- (b) Reversible payments 
-- (c) Complete anonymity
-- (d) Long-term inflationary monetary model
-- c and d
-- none of the above


Bitcoin is the first monetary system to credibly offer perfect information to all economic participants.
--* True
-- False


How is Bitcoin different than E-gold?
-- E-gold was used to send money internationally
-- Bitcoin use is often pseudonymous
--* Bitcoin is an open protocol with no single entity responsible for the entire system
-- There is no fundamental difference


Which is a historically accepted property of a 'good' money?
-- Scarcity
-- Durability
-- Fungibility
-- Recognizability
-- Portability
-- Divisibility
--* All of the above


A soft-fork is considered backward-compatible with older bitcoin software.
--* True
-- False


What causes a hard-fork?
--* New Bitcoin software which expands block-acceptance rules relative to earlier versions.
-- When a single transaction contains multiple outputs
-- New Bitcoin software which restricts block-acceptance rules relative to earlier versions.
-- When a single transaction contains multiple inputs


What is generally being referred to when discussing a miner's 'memory pool'?
-- The list of that node's peer nodes
-- The list of a miner's spent nonces for the current block
-- The list of recently confirmed transactions by that miner
--* The list of unconfirmed transactions of which the miner is aware


A hard-fork is considered backward-compatible with older bitcoin software.
-- True
--* False


What are some arguments against raising the max-blocksize limit?
-- (a) Raising the limit will make it easier for small-operators to run full-nodes
--* (b) Raising the limit will make it harder for small-operators to run full-nodes
-- (c) Raising the limit will make it harder for large-operators to run full-nodes
-- (d) Raising the limit may break SHA-256 hashing assumptions
-- a and b
-- b and c
-- a, b, and c
-- a, b, c, and d


What are some arguments in favor of raising the max-blocksize limit?
-- (a) Raising the limit will allow Bitcoin to scale-up transaction volume
-- (b) Raising the limit will likely reduce transaction fees in the long-run
-- (c) Raising the limit will make transactions confirm faster
-- (d) Raising the limit may break SHA-256 hashing assumptions
--* a and b
-- b and c
-- a, b, and c
-- a, b, c, and d


Why were graphics cards suited to Bitcoin's mining algorithm?
-- Because they have a lot of built-in memory
-- Because they're better than most CPUs at general serial computation
--* Because they're very good at parallel computation
-- Graphics cards were not used for bitcoin mining


Which mining-hardware technology generally uses the least energy per hash-computation?
-- GPUs
-- FPGAs
--* ASICs
-- CPUs


Can transaction malleability change the address(es) to which the bitcoin contained in a given transaction goes?
-- Yes
--* No
